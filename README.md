# Overview

This project is created for personal learning purposes; with it, I try to recreate some of my social science research which I have opportunities to touch on in my university years.

Initially, this project will focus on researching 3 main data sets:

1. [Phân loại rác thải](phan-loai-rac-thai):
2. [My graduation thesis about coaching in organization](spino-coaching-thesis):
3. [World Value Survey 7](wvs_7): 
    - This dataset is obtained at ... I've used it to write my first research paper, which, until now, I still consider my best research paper in my university life. The research is about [Life satisfaction of Vietnamese in a developing economy](wvs_7/docs/Life-satisfaction-Vietnamese-in-a-developing-economy.pdf). After doing it, I've come to realize the potential of the dataset so I want to exploit it more in this project.
