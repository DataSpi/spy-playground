# Overview

At first, this project is created for personal learning purposes; with it, I try to recreate some of my social science research which I have opportunities to touch on in my university years. But after that, I've realized there are so much potentially interesting datasets online for me to discovery, I convert this repo to a playground for me to hang out & have fun with any dataset I found interested in.

Initially, this project will focus on researching 3 main data sets:

1. [Phân loại rác thải](phan-loai-rac-thai):
2. [My graduation thesis about coaching in organization](spino-coaching-thesis):
3. [World Value Survey 7](wvs_7):
    - The World Values Survey (WVS) is a global research project that aims to investigate the changing values and beliefs of people worldwide. It is conducted in various countries and covers a wide range of topics, including politics, religion, gender equality, and social norms. The survey provides valuable insights into cultural, social, and political shifts over time, allowing researchers to analyze and compare data from different societies to better understand the dynamics of human values and behavior. More information about the dataset can be found at https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp 
    - The dataset used in this project is the wave 7 of WVS. I've used it to write my first research paper, which, until now, I still consider my best research paper in my university life. The research is about [Life satisfaction of Vietnamese in a developing economy](wvs_7/docs/Life-satisfaction-Vietnamese-in-a-developing-economy.pdf). After doing it, I've come to realize the potential of the dataset so I want to exploit it more in this project.
